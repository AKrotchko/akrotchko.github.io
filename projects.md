## Projects

Below is a list of some of my published works. I have a lot of small passion projects that don't get published anywhere, but I hope to get an app to the Google Play Store shortly.

#### Completed Professional Projects

 - [Amtrak.com](https://www.amtrak.com/) I worked as a front-end developer on the release of the new Amtrak experience for two years.
 
 I cannot disclose my current work.

#### Personal Projects

 - This site! It's something I'm making for fun, but it's also a good place to share my work.
 - [Judge Bot](https://github.com/AKrotchko/judge_bot) A Discord bot that utilizes the Discord API in order to do intelligent lookups in real time based on user interaction in a Discord channel. It also does some other cool things. I continue to update this bot when I have extra time. Judge Bot is written as a dart console application.
 - There is a flutter application I am currently working on for fun related to one of the games that I enjoy playing. I won't be releasing it until I have more free time.
