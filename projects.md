I have been a developer full-time for about 5 years now, so I have at least a couple different projects that are published you can check out.

- 2020 - [Amtrak.com](https://www.amtrak.com/home.html) I was part of the major devleopment effort to completely refresh the Amtrak.com experience. I primarily focused on front-end development with Angular.
- 2022 - [AlertAware](https://alertaware.com/) I am currently developing the front-end experience for AlertAware. You can find the mobile client on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alertaware.mobile&hl=en_US&gl=US), or the iOS [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alertaware-mobile/id1635823148). Also available on the web (how neat is that) on our [Web Portal](https://portal.alertaware.com/). You can even use your own custom internal domain
- 2023 - [Alertus Activator](https://www.alertus.com/activator-app) I am the sole developer and maintainer for this project, which I inherited in 2023. Currently updating features for our "Rapid-Response Console" mode, delivering instant activations at our customers fingertips. Available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alertus.dispatcher&hl=en_US&gl=US) or the iOS [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alertus-activator/id687223521)
- 2023 - [Alertus Recipient App](https://www.alertus.com/app) I am the sole developer and maintainer for this project, which I inherited in 2023. I continue to push new features and updates frequently. Currently working on a complete back-end replacement, hoping to merge with the AlertAware back-end. You can download it on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alertus.mobile_receiver&hl=en_US&gl=US) or the iOS [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alertus/id896799884)

If you want me to show some of this off, let me know!
