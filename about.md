## Andrew Krotchko

I am a full-time front-end developer with a background creating mobile and web applications. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional interfaces. I have a background in web development and have worked with many different technologies and frameworks. Here are a few of my favorite technologies:

 - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
 - [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
 - [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)
 - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 - [Java](https://www.java.com/)

 I am always looking to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I am always looking to improve my skills.
