### Stuff I Like/Do

- I love to work on and appreciate cars. My 2017 GTI is pretty sweet.
- Big cat-person! Here's my best buddy, Cyril
- Always looking for an opportunity to go on a hike
- I love to tinker. You should see my Raspberry Pi server, it's pretty cool.

### The boring professional stuff

I am a full-time front-end developer with a background creating mobile and web applications. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional interfaces. I have a background in web development and have worked with many different technologies and frameworks. Here are a few of my favorite technologies:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/)

I am always looking to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I am always looking to improve my skills.
