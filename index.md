I'm a mobile applications developer working for [Alertus Technologies](https://www.alertus.com/), primarily focused on front-end development. I'm responsible for maintaining our customer-facing applications for iOS and Android. If you want a bit more information about them, check out my projects.

I've been doing full-stack development for about five years, with an expertise in Flutter and Java development.
