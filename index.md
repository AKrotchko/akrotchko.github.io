I've been doing full-stack development for about five years, with an expertise in Flutter and Java development. I'm a mobile applications developer working for [Alertus Technologies](https://www.alertus.com/), primarily focused on front-end development. I'm responsible for maintaining our customer-facing applications for iOS and Android.
